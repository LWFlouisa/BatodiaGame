# BatodiaGame
A simple bridge between Roguelikes and Text Adventures.

## Outline
Plot generator creates a new story each playthrough that is bare bones, but allows the player to imagine a scenario more complex than is actually present or stated explicitely.

Decisions are made using a visual novel like branching narrative.

Dungeons are explored using text adventure framework.
  * Except in battle, where you navigate a dot matrix.

You instruct an AI to navigate dungeons. Like your pearing from a window.

An inference engine is used to quiz the AI on existing knowledge.

A knowledge base is modified by prior experience AI has had.

Other AI aspects can be controlled using a basic chatbot in AIML. AIML bot and main gameplay seperate engines.
